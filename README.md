# Brief Introduction and Motivation:
> We want to undertake the Get Home Safely application as a project for ISEE SoSe19. This project will allow us to learn to work in a team which is very crucial to work in the industry environment. Since, no one of us has previously worked on Android, this will be a new learning curve for us. This particular application because many a times all of us have experienced the situation when we are out late at night and when we go our separate ways, we inform each other via text messages when we reach home safely. Since, it happens frequently we believe that it is a better option to have if peers can get notified automatically upon reaching home.
