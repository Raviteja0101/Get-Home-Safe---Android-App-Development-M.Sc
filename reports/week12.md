### Current progress made

#### Development & Implementation

This week we focused heavily on the logic behind the notification and making sure the appropriate notification is sent to the desired user. We have been able to successfully implement pani, pause and abort button. Some issues still need to be resolved with the notifications that are sent when a user diverges from its path. Additional issues that we face are proper and reliable selection of users to receive the notification. Some bugs need to be fixed.
