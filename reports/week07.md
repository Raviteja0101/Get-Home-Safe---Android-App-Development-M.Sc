### Current progress made

The previous week we finalised our backend API design using Node.js with express and MySQL. We have implemented the basic workflow of the API to manage a request/response cycle. Also, in accordance to our current needs we have designed database tables and have finished creating them for use in Backend API. For frontend(Android) part we have implemented the SignIn/SignOut functionality using Google's API. It is working and is available as downloadable apk file on both GitHub repository and Requirement Analysis and System Modelling blog. We also started to integrate Google Maps into our application but we faced some difficulties and we are trying to rectify them. Hence, we could not incorporate that into our Basic Prototype of the application.
