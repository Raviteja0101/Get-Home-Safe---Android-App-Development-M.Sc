* Retrieving phone's Contact List
* Integrated Google Maps, with GPS fetch functionality and Search place functionality
* Revisited and redesign layouts 

#### Testing & Quality Management

This week we ran a non-functional testing (penetration testing) to see how vulnerable our app is. Vulnerabilities can lead to some unfortunate events, especially since we store user data like phone numbers and coordinates. The test was conducted on the advanced prototype and some bugs were identified. We are currently working on resolving these issues by the release of the beta version.

Responsibilities for each team member include:
* Xiongjun Wang (Cecilia) - UI redesign and write report.
* Boris Djartov - Retrieving phone's Contact List and specifying which users to select.
* Ravi Teja - Functional, Non-Functional and Security testing.
* Tarun Gupta -  Integrated Google Maps and retrieving phone's Contact List.
