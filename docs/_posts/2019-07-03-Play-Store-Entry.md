Welcome to our last blog, where we pitch our app to the safety concerned users. We will give a brief summary of our application as well as talk about some of its great features. We would like to show our users just how useful our application can be and encourage them to try it out.

## Application Summary

Simply put our application focuses on making the user feel safe and have peace of mind. With our application you can feel safe knowing that people who are concerned about you are watching over you as you make your journey home. Additionally you can have the peace of mind knowing exactly what is going on with your friends and family during their journey home. <b>"Go Home Safely"</b> provides an opportunity for anyone to keep an eye on their loved ones as they make their journey home and be up to date with any changes in their plans. You will no longer be worried whether your friend is home safely or not just because he/she forgot to text or call you when he/she gets home. With our application second guessing what is going on with your friends or family during their journey home will be a thing of the past.

## Features

Our application has a multitude of features geared for our users needs and wants. 

Our feature lists include:
* ## GPS tracking.
* ## Unlimited number of emergency contacts.
* ## Interactive maps.
* ## Destination specification.
* ## Live distance tracking within the app
* ## Easy selection of potential followers from contacts list.
* ## Notifications when a followee when he reaches his destination (reason needs to be specified, which followers receive as notifications)
* ## Possible for followee to pause journey and resume, because things don't always go as planned (reason needs to be specified, which followers receive as notifications).
* ## Possible for the followee to cancel the jorney at any time.
* ## SOS button which sends out a distress notification to all the followers.
