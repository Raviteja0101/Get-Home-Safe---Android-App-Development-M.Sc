# Team Members
* ### Xiongjun Wang (Cecilia)
> I was born and raised in China, but I studied in the USA for 3 years. 
In my previous studies I was in a double degree program for Bachelor degree of Science in Aeronautics and 
Bachelor degree of Engineering in Air Traffic Management. After that I worked at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport 
as an Operational Commander for nearly 3 years. In 2018, I came to Germany and worked at Lufthansa. 
But later on, I decided I want to be a Data Analyst, because I am always interested to find the logical connection 
and truth behind data. This is the reason why I am studying DE at OVGU. 
I donâ€™t have much programming experience, 
but I am studying Python and Java on my own and always willing to learn more and improve my skills.
* ### Boris Djartov
> My previous background as an Industrial engineer has enabled me to understand the value and importance of optimization and well carried out work. Developing an android app will provide a new and interesting challenge, one which will further my knowledge in the field of software and programming and hopefully be a lot of fun.
* ### Tarun Gupta
> Coming from an engineering background but with a professional experience of more than 2.5 years in IT industry 
as a Backend Software Developer has allowed me to learn how to work in teams and 
I intend to use that to full extent in the development of this project. 
The development of an Android application is a whole new venture for me 
and I am very excited to take this challenge on. 
The motivation behind this project is to learn how to develop technological solutions 
for mobile devices for the corporate world. 
Since I have worked with Python and Node.js as of now, working with Java on Android is going to be an exciting challenge.

# Why this project? And brief introduction about the application plans 
> We want to undertake the Get Home Safely application as a project for ISEE SoSe19. This project will allow us to learn to work in a team which is very crucial in industry . Since, no one of us has previously worked on Android, there will be a new and steep learning curve for all of us. 
> We choose this particular application because many a times we have experienced situations when we have to go our separate ways after a night out and text our friends that we are home safe. Thus we believe it would be very beneficial if our friends could easily and conveniently be notified of our safe arrival without much effort or fuss from us.
