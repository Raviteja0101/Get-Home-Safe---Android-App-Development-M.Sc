                                            Our system uses the MVC (Model View Controller) framework design pattern.

                                            <img style="width: 115%" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/MVCdiagram.png"
                                                alt="">

                                            The Model View Controller separates the application into three main logical
                                            components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these
                                            components are built to handle specific development aspects of an
                                            application.

                                            The Model component takes care of all the data-related logic that the user
                                            interacts with. This usually refers to all the data that is being
                                            transferred between the View and Controller components, but it can also
                                            include any other business logic-related data.

                                            The View component corresponds to the UI logic of the application. For
                                            example, the Start Journey view will include all the UI components such as
                                            text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user can interact with.

                                            Controllers act as a bridge between Model and View components to process all
                                            the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model
                                            component and interact with the Views to render the final output.

                                            As our application needs frequent communication to get the users coordinates
                                            as well as to keep users informed of all the position their friends we
                                            believe MVC design pattern would be a good fit. We will get the data that
                                            the user enters (source, destination) using the views and via the controller
                                            we will get the data from Google Maps API and we can send this information
                                            to our model to store it in database and then hand back the control to
                                            controller for next task to compute. We believe it is a robust design
                                            pattern that fits our needs.

                                            Coding conventions are important to have good and understandable code as
                                            well as to reduce stress in figuring out what someone else’s code does.
                                            Having this in mind for our backend we will be using the ES.5.1
                                            specification and for our frontend we will be using the Draft java coding
                                            conventions. To make sure that we keep in line with the coding conventions
                                            that we set for our project in our system for tasks assignment in the review
                                            phase where at least one other team member will review the code, he/she will
                                            also check for any deviations from the coding conventions so that they can
                                            be corrected. For our Coding conventions we will be following the

                                                straightforward design principles. We also focus on a more minimalistic
                                                style and avoid clutter. We strive to find the right amount of content
                                                per screen. We also favor a flatter look which underlines our design
                                                principles of simplicity and usability. We believe simple elegant and
                                                beautiful design is important and we strive to make our users feel
                                                comfortable while using our app. We strive to apply these same design
                                                principles in other aspects of our application </p>

                                                Our homage Is a little more interesting having icons with various
                                                colors. These colors help distinguish the icons from each other, but
                                                they are still compatible with each other and the other design elements

                                                for our accents). We additionally employ a nice beige grey to give the
                                                application a beautiful and interesting look. We selected blue because
                                                It is a colour that symbolizes loyalty, strength, wisdom and trust. Blue
                                                color is also known to have a calming effect on the psyche and as with
