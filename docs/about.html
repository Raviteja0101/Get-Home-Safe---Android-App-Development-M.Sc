                     <h3>Xiongjun Wang (Cecilia)</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in China, but I studied in the USA for 3 years. In my previous studies I was in a double degree program for Bachelor degree of Science in Aeronautics and Bachelor degree of Engineering in Air Traffic Management. After that I worked at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport as an Operational Commander for nearly 3 years. In 2018, I came to Germany and worked at Lufthansa. But later on, I decided I want to be a Data Analyst, because I am always interested to find the logical connection and truth behind data. This is the reason why I am studying DE at OVGU. I do not have much programming experience, but I am studying Python and Java on my own and always willing to learn more and improve my skills.</p>

                <h3>Boris Djartov</h3>
                <p>My previous background as an Industrial engineer has enabled me to understand the value and importance of optimization and well carried out work. Developing an android app will provide a new and interesting challenge, one which will further my knowledge in the field of software and programming and hopefully be a lot of fun.</p>
                </a>
                <h3>Tarun Gupta</h3>
                <p>Coming from an engineering background but with a professional experience of more than 2.5 years in IT industry as a Backend Software Developer has allowed me to learn how to work in teams and I intend to use that to full extent in the development of this project. The development of an Android application is a whole new venture for me and I am very excited to take this challenge on. The motivation behind this project is to learn how to develop technological solutions for mobile devices for the corporate world. Since I have worked with Python and Node.js as of now, working with Java on Android is going to be an exciting challenge.</p>
                  </p>
                <h3>Raviteja Adapa</h3>
                <p>Application development is one of those areas which always excited me but I neved had an oppurtunity to get my hands on it, I come from an engineering background with around 5 years experience in IT industry, gave me oppurtunities to work on Server & network administration in Agile methodology and IT security consultancy for various web applications and source code. I am glad to be a part of this team which will widen my horizons in the app development area and various sprints involved in achieving this feat.</p>
